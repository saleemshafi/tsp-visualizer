Traveling Salesman Problem Visualizer
==============================

This browser-based tool is designed to help you with the Traveling Salesman Problem in the [Coursera Discrete Optimization class](https://class.coursera.org/optimization-003).

It does NOT create solutions to the problem, it simply displays your solution to you so that we can get a sense of what your algorithm is and isn't doing.

Usage
--------

To use the tool, simply open the index.html file in your browser, then select the problem you are working on, and paste in your solution (space-delimited list of nodes) into the "Cycle" box.

After pasting your solution, you should see the path through the nodes displayed on the right-hand side.

You will also see a calculation of the length of your path.  You can edit your node list and see the effect, and the distance will also update to help you see whether or not your manual change made the path better or worse.
